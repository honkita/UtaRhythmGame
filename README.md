# UtaRhythmGame
# Origin
The project originally started out as a project for a high school computer science course. This was one of my original larger scale projects. As a rhythm game player, I decided to make this as my final game for the course. I was inspired by other four key games such as OsuMania and Dance Dance Revolution. 

# Song Choices
As a big anime nerd and rhythm game player, I picked one song from a rhythm game and another one from a J-Pop/J-Rock group I liked. I went with Sairai by Shinichi Kobayashi Tsunoru Kimochi by CHiCO with HoneyWorks. Sairai appears in many Rayark rhythm games such as Deemo, Deemo II, and Cytus II. Tsunoru Kimochi is a song created by the Japanese vocaloid circle/group HoneyWorks and sung by ChiCO, forming the band ChiCO with HoneyWorks from 2014-2023.
